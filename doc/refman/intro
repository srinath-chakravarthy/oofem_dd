\section Introduction Introduction
The idea of OOFEM is to provide a highly modular, easily extensible, high level, and robust environment for anyone wishing to write new FE code.
OOFEM has a core library which currently 3 modules that extend the implementations (structural, fluid and heat/mass transfer problems).

Here is a list of OOFEMlib highlights:
 - object oriented architecture
 - modular and extensible FEM kernel
 - fully extensible - The kernel is extensible in any "direction". The possibility of
   adding new element type, new material model with any type and number of internal
   history parameters, new boundary condition, new numerical algorithm or new
   analysis module is matter of course.
 - threaded assembly
 - PETSc bindings for parallel solvers
 - support for exotic elements, boundary conditions, etc.
 - independent problem formulation, numerical solution and data storage  -
   The kernel provides the independent abstractions for analysis, general numerical
   method and data storage (sparse matrices). The component mapping concept
   allows to formulate problem and numerical method independently and allows to use
   any suitable numerical method for problem solution without changes. This concept is
   further enhanced by abstract sparse matrix interface, allowing to formulate
   numerical method independently on sparse matrix implementation.
 - full restart support - The kernel supports full restart from any previously saved state.
 - export functions (VTK format and more)
 - support for parallel processing (message passing) - General classes for
   efficient inter domain communication are provided  built over the abstract general
   layer for message passing libraries, which is available on many parallel platforms
   (massively parallel computers, shared memory systems and workstation clusters).
 - adaptive analysis support - multiple domain concept, fast spatial localization algorithms 
   based on tree techniques are available.
 - includes enhanced support for structural analysis, flow problems and heat/mass transfer.
