The test suite allows for quality control by developers. 
Test-suite guidelines:
- As few elements and time steps as possible (aim for elements < 5 and time steps < 5)
- Each test should test one specific component (or possible test a few similar elements inside the same test file)
- There should be no redundant tests, e.g. maximum one test per element should suffice.

Larger benchmark problems may be added to the benchmark folder, but these should not be expected to be executed regurlarly be developers.
These benchmarks don't need to be very large. They can be simple showcase example that should be included with the OOFEM distribution.
If a benchmark problems ever finds a problem that the test-suite misses, a smaller version of the benchmark problem should be added to the test suite.
