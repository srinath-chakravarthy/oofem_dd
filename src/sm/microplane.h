/**
 * Class representing microplane integration point in finite element program.
 * Microplane always belongs to macro integration point and
 * represents micro material level. Microplanes are created by particular microplane
 * material model.
 * Because all corresponding microplanes in all macro integration points
 * subjected to particular material share the same properties (same normals,
 * same integration weights), these are stored only once at material model level.
 * Thus requests for microplane integration weights and normal are forwarded
 * to corresponding material model.
 *
 * Generally, every integration point must hold
 * its own copy of history variables (which are related to corresponding
 * material model used). These material type dependent history variables
 * are stored in material type related material status, which can be
 * managed by integration point.
 * Each material model class should introduce related material status class
 * (derived from material status class or from its children), where necessary
 * history variables are kept and can be accessed by material.
 * Material class then creates unique copy of related status in all necessary
 * integration points. Because integration point is compulsory parameter of
 * all member functions of material class, particular material then can
 * easily access its associated status from integration point and therefore its
 * history variables for particular integration point.
