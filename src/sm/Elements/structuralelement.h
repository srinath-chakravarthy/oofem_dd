/**
 * Abstract base class for all "structural" finite elements. It declares common interface provided
 * by all derived elements. The implementation of these services is partly left on derived classes,
 * some general services are implemented here generally (But they can be overload by more efficient
 * element implementation).
 * The general implementation provided here is intended for both linear and nonlinear computations.
 * At this level, only material model nonlinearities are taken into account. If particular element type
 * will participate in geometrically nonlinear computations, it should be derived from derived
 * NLStructuralElement class, which provide support for this cases.
 *
 * The basic data of an element are the numbers of its 'numberOfNodes' nodes,
 * stored in 'nodeArray', of its 'material', of its body loads (eg, the dead
 * weight) stored in 'loadArray'. These data are obtained from the domain.
 * The element contains logical reference to Volume object (
 * which stores material,geometrical characteristics, integration points, state of
 * material and so on)
 * The calculated data of an element are its 'massMatrix', its 'stiffnessMatrix'
 * its 'locationArray'. Since the load vector is recalculated at every
 * time step, it is not given the status of attribute.
 *
 * Tasks:
 * - Obtaining its basic data, the element reads in the data file the number
 *   of these objects, then obtains the data from the domain (methods
 *   'giveNode', 'giveMaterial',etc).
 * - Calculating its contribution to the problem :
 *   Calculating its mass matrix M, its stiffness matrix K, its load vector
 *   f, its location array.
 *   Calculating its contribution to the LHS and RHS of the linear system,
 *   using Static,Newmark,etc, formula. These contributions are usually
 *   combinations of M,K,f.
 * - Performing end-of-step operations;
 *   Calculating the strains and stresses at its Gauss points.
 * - Printing its output in the data file and updating itself.
